"June 12 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in a rain-drenched central China province said on Sunday that a landslide that killed 12 people and left seven others missing earlier this week was not triggered by man-made causes.  The landslide hit the village of Guanshan at Friday dawn after torrential rains, estimated to be the heaviest to hit the area in 300 years, pounded the city of Linxiang in Hunan Province for about six hours, according to the results of an official probe.  The results said that the region's recent severe drought made the ground more dry than usual, allowing the heavy rains to sweep away sand and rocks. This resulted in a landslide that roared down a mountain slope 300 meters above Guanshan.

"(Landslide may have occurred before April 18). A huge landslide has opened up a giant 900ft crevice along a cliff - dramatically changing the face of Britain's famous Jurassic Coast. The colossal crack emerged in the land's edge at Bowleaze Cove near Weymouth, Dorset, after thousands of tons of earth suddenly gave way following heavy rainfall.  It has almost cut the land in two and officials have been forced to close a footpath on the side of the crack as it is feared further movement will occur.  Excessive rainfall has led to water seeping through the limestone. That has then mixed with the clay, making it far heavier than before. With the cliff unable to support the additional weight, the land has eventually broken off and slid towards the sea.  Coastguards are now warning people to stay away from the unpredictable and 'unstable' area which is going to start dropping 'like an elevator'.

"One man is known to have died and another is still missing following a landslide at Kolti in the Bajura District of Western Nepal on the evening of Saturday 7 June/2014. The dead man has been named as Gore Rokaya (58), while Kar Budha (45) is still missing.

Incessant rainfall with landslides claimed three lives while six houses were swept away in Kolti VDC of Bajura, on Satu"

"Neighbors at the Forest Edge apartment complex along Beavercreek Road are worried an entire hill might give way and crash into their homes.  On Monday night, a small landslide sent mud down a steep hill and into a garage. Clackamas County firefighters say the damage wasn't major and there were no reported injuries.  However, some residents have decided to leave for fear that a much bigger slide is on its way.  Geologists went to the site Tuesday morning to check the hill's stability. Crews say the hill is unstable, but there is no indication that there would be a massive slide.  Monday night's slide brought down several small trees and caused some damage to the roof of the garage.  Crews have roped off a section of land near the slide. The manager of a nearby apartment complex says he put up a large tarp on his property in early January to prevent a washout.  This is the latest in a series of small slides in the metro area."

"If a landslide occurs in a remote mountain range but nobody sees or hears it, does it matter? Unequivocally yes, says Columbia University geophysicist and landslide specialist Colin Stark. Even when they occur in remote areas, large landslides can dam rivers and lead to devastating downstream floods.??It??s especially critical that we monitor ??catastrophic?? landslides -- fast-moving slides that involve more than a million tons of debris,?? Stark says. ??These are the most dangerous landslides, but they often go undetected.?? Stark is working to change that. Along with colleague G_ran Ekstr_m, he has pioneered a new method to detect landslides by analyzing seismic waves -- the vibrations that radiate through Earth??s crust because of sudden movements of rock, ice, magma, or debris. Stark and his colleagues used the technique to locate the landslide shown in the satellite images above. Automated earthquake detection systems are tuned to monitor intense, ??short-period?? waves produced by sudden "
